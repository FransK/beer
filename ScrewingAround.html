		<h1>The best part of waking up, is Folgers in your cup!</h1>
		<h2>Here are a few things that you should know about coffee!</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Clean water makes all the difference</li>
			<li>The right grind is very important. Too course and it'll taste like toilet water. Too fine and it'll taste like swamp water! </li> 
			<li>Time is key. The longer you brew, the more bitter the coffee tastes. You want to pull out all the sour and sweetness from the bean while only grabbing a touch of the bitter.
	  <p>So what does all of this have to do with beer? Nothing. But that's okay. Have you noticed that I'm just "Screwing Around" here?</p> 
    <p>Anyway... What can we say about beer?</p>  
    <h2>Here's a few things you should know off the bat:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>India pale ales, (IPAs) have a ton of that hippidy hoppy goodness because they had to travel on long sea voyages from India to get the beer here.</li>
      <li>Wheat ales tend to have crazy huge heads on 'em! Careful pouring!</li>
      <li>Lagers are crisp, and easy drinking. Sweeter than pale ales.
